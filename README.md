**Using HuggingFace AutoTrain JSON chunks**

Extract Data from MongoDB:

Use a MongoDB client (like pymongo) to query and retrieve data from your MongoDB collections.
Convert the retrieved data into a format suitable for training, like a pandas DataFrame.
Preprocess and Train:

Preprocess the data (e.g., tokenization, label encoding) using Hugging Face transformers and datasets.
Train the model as you've done in your script.
Push to Hub or Deploy:

Once trained, you can push the model to the Hugging Face Hub or deploy it in your environment.

First off install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In your project folder name it what you wish add some JSON data
```
[
    {
        "text": "This is a positive example.",
        "label": "positive"
    },
    {
        "text": "This is a negative example.",
        "label": "negative"
    },
    {
        "text": "This is another positive example.",
        "label": "positive"
    },
    {
        "text": "This is another negative example.",
        "label": "negative"
    }
]
```
